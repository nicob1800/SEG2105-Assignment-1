This project implements a Java-based vehicle management and event handling system for SEG2105. It features a robust vehicle hierarchy starting from an abstract Vehicle base class and Printable interface, which uses encapsulation and custom exceptions to manage specific land and air vehicles like cars, bikes, and planes. Additionally, the repository includes an event management system using the EventHandler interface for logging and alerts , along with a student sorting utility that demonstrates natural ordering and custom Comparator implementations.
